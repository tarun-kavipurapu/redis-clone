this works on principle of random sampling which says that if you pick 20 keys randomly and the expiry percentage
among them is more than 25 percent then we can say the entire set also have more than 25 percent expired keys
here.

Here golang hash map when iterated gives keys randomly

redis does this differntly where they have seperate maps for expired keys and only that map is iterated
